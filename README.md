# Web Scraping Part two
The purpose of this script is to scrape the text that we want across multiple pages of a website. this script we will be scraping one-star titles from a bookstore  web page with 50 pages using the BeautifulSoup library. The script uses the get request function to extract the URL '"http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-{}.html". We only wanted to look at one star titles of books within the first 5 pages.
 The output is a list of one star titles within the first 5 pages of the books store.
